Welcome to this repository.

The name is `random-codes` but actually the codes here are instructive, educative, and meaningful.

I code in C/C++, please use a typical C/C++ compiler (e.g. gcc, g++, clang, clang++) to compile and run the codes here.

Please feel free to submit issues and improve the codes here.
